Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["Americans",
"Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in ["Baseball","cricket"].

Hint: Subject,Verb and Object should be declared in the program as shown below.

subjects=["Americans ","Indians"]
verbs=["play","watch"]
objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]

Output should come as below:

Americans play Baseball.
Americans play Cricket.
Americans watch Baseball.
Americans watch Cricket.
Indians play Baseball.
Indians play Cricket.
Indians watch Baseball.
Indians watch Cricket.

Solution:

subjects = ["Americans", "Indians"]
verbs = ["Play", "watch"]
objects = ["Baseball","cricket"]

# By using list comprehension
sentence_list = [(s+" "+ v + " " + o) for s in subjects for v in verbs for o in objects]
for sentence in sentence_list:
    print (sentence)
